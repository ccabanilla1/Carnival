# Carnival
This project is a C++ simulation of a carnival, featuring multiple rides and a system for managing patrons. It includes various classes representing different rides, such as Magic Carpet, Teacups, and World Tour. The project utilizes object-oriented principles to simulate the behavior and interactions of patrons as they experience different carnival rides.

# Features
- Simulates a carnival with multiple rides.
- Manages patrons and their interactions with the rides.
- Provides a modular and extensible structure using object-oriented programming principles.

# File Structure
- magicCarpet.cpp/h: Implements the Magic Carpet ride.
- teacups.cpp/h: Implements the Teacups ride.
- worldTour.cpp/h: Implements the World Tour ride.
- patron.cpp/h: Manages the patrons in the carnival.
- driver.cpp: The main driver program that orchestrates the simulation.
- patronList.txt: Contains data related to the patrons participating in the carnival.
- makefile: Facilitates the build process for the project.

# Credits
This project was developed in collaboration with Connor Jordan.
